Frasier is Toyota’s Human Support Robot (HSR), a prototype research platform for service robots. It has been one of RIVeR lab’s main research tools in its line of robots. The RIVeR lab was one of the few US universities that were awarded the robot to participate in Robocup@Home and join a passionate group of researchers who wish to integrate robotics in a home environment. FRASIER stands for, Fostering Reslient Aging with Self-Efficacy and Independence Enabling Robot, which shows our commitment to developing robotic systems that foster resilient aging. In the past, Team Northeastern has succeeded through the use of classical techniques, this year's team will focus on applying learning based techniques to train HSR how to complete tasks. This will enable us to conduct research comparing the pros and cons of deploying classical and learning based techniques on standard robotic platforms, such as HSR.

# Previous Participation in RoboCup@Home

</div>

---
##### RoboCup@Home 2019: Sydney, Australia
At RoboCup@Home 2019, Team Northeastern was once again the best performing US team, and was invited to attend the 2020 World Robot Summit, where we placed 3rd.

###### RoboCup@Home 2018: Montreal, Canada
Our second Robocup@Home competition gave us with the opportunity to showcase our research in manipulation & perception. Team Northeastern placed 2nd in stage 1, and 4th in stage 2 & 3, receiving the “Best in Manipulation” Award. Team Northeastern was the best performing US team.

###### RoboCup@Home 2017: Nagoya, Japan
The RIVeR Lab’s Robocup@Home debut and first home robotics competition. Team Northeastern competed against 15 teams from all over the world. PhD student Tarik Kelestemur and Anas Abou Allaban tackled the “Storing Groceries” and “Speech & Person Recognition” tasks.
