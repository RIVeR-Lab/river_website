## FRASIER in Action:

{{< youtube D-on06obYLo >}}

## Information:

Frasier is Toyota’s Human Support Robot (HSR), a prototype research platform for service robots. It has been one of RIVeR lab’s main research tools in its line of robots. The RIVeR lab was one of the few US universities that were awarded the robot to participate in Robocup@Home and join a passionate group of researchers who wish to integrate robotics in a home environment. We have been awarded a second HSR to participate at the World Robot Summit thanks to our performance at Robocup@Home!

## Previous Participation in RoboCup@Home:

#### RoboCup@Home 2018: Montreal, Canada
Our second Robocup@Home competition gave us with the opportunity to showcase our research in manipulation & perception. Team Northeastern placed 2nd in stage 1, and 4th in stage 2 & 3, receiving the “Best in Manipulation” Award. Team Northeastern was the best performing US team and was invited to attend the World Robot Summit in Tokyo, Japan.

#### RoboCup@Home 2017: Nagoya, Japan
The RIVeR Lab’s Robocup@Home debut and first home robotics competition. Team Northeastern competed against 15 teams from all over the world. PhD student Tarik Kelestemur and Anas Abou Allaban tackled the “Storing Groceries” and “Speech & Person Recognition” tasks.
