Drake Moore is a first year PhD student in computer engineering. His research interests lie in enabling robots to assist humans in day-to-day tasks through methods such as shared control, environment modeling, and robot learning.

Fun fact: Drake has been to every continent except Antarctica. He will hopefully make the journey next year.
