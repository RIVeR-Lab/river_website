## Biography

Nathaniel’s research interests lie at the intersection of remote sensing technologies and robotics. His dissertation focuses on bringing hyperspectral imaging and near infrared spectroscopy into lighter, cheaper form factors for use in household robots. His current thrust involves using non-contact material estimation methods to infer object properties such as weight and friction. He welcomes all collaborations on practical applications of hyperspectral imaging in real-time processing and vision systems that extend beyond the visible wavelengths of light.

Fun fact: Nathaniel has played backup trumpet to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Band Chicago and Grammy Award Winner Arturo Sandoval
