## Biography

Austin Allison is a first-year PhD student in bioengineering. His research interests will be predominantly focused on a next-generation robotic prosthetic hand. It will incorporate hyperspectral imaging sensors to infer material properties. Using this information, appropriate grasp mechanics can be selected by the hand, allowing for a greater amount of shared control between the user and the robot. This is an interdisciplinary project, sharing aspects between biomedical engineering and robotics.

Fun fact: Austin took a dairy cow handling class during senior year, where the class learned how to milk cows, everything about cow judging, and even toured a dairy that had a robotic automatic milking and processing machine.
