## Biography

Austin Allison is a first-year PhD student in bioengineering. His research interests will be predominantly focused on a next-generation robotic prosthetic hand. It will incorporate hyperspectral imaging sensors to infer material properties. Using this information, appropriate grasp mechanics can be selected by the hand, allowing for a greater amount of shared control between the user and the robot.

Fun fact: Austin took a dairy cow handling class senior year where they learned how to milk and judge cows, and toured a dairy with a robotic milking machine.
