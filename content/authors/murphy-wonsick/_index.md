## Biography

Murphy Wonsick is a postdoctoral research associate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Northeastern University. Murphy has received two Bachelors of Science degrees from Florida Institute of Technology, one in Computer Science and the other in Mathematical Sciences, and a Master of Science in Robotics Engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Her current research focuses on identifying ways to utilize extended reality technologies (i.e., virtual reality and augmented reality headsets) to improve human-robot interaction and collaboration. She is also developing various interfaces for humanoid robots, including a virtual reality interface and a QT (a cross-platform user-interface framework) interface, and directly comparing these interfaces to create a modular and reconfigurable, humanoid robot interface for inexperienced users. Murphy's current areas of interest include human-robot interaction, heterogeneous human-robot teams, virtual reality, augmented reality, and user experience and interface design.

Fun fact: Murphy maintains the world's longest to-do list.
