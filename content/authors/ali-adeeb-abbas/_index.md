## Biography

As a first-year Ph.D. student at Northeastern University, I am deeply engaged in the robotics. My research endeavors include delving into the complexities of control during physical interactions, developing strategies for motion planning, and deciphering the subtle dance of nonlinear dynamics.

In pursuit of enhancing robotic agility and effectiveness, I am exploring trajectory optimization along with the transformative potential of reinforcement learning. These studies aim to contribute to the field by improving the way robots adapt and respond to their environment, with an underlying interest in behavior cloning and implicit learning as tools to foster these advancements.


Fun fact: Ali juggles fluency in three languages while mastering two more, as part of a family whose linguistic prowess spans over five languages!
