## Biography

As a Graduate Research Assistant, Carv has been leaning on his past experiences of working in the Product Development industry to help streamline the robust design and physical prototyping of some of the lab's robotic solutions. Most recently, he led the development of the customized foam spray gun end-effector for P.A.R.I.S., the air-sealing robot that the lab submitted to the DoE's E-ROBOT competition. Under Prof. Padirâ€™s guidance, Carv hopes to be able to "carve" out a thesis project that incorporates many of his technical interests.

Fun fact: As part of a recording musical group in Ecuador, his paternal grandfather sang and played the guitar; as part of an established orchestral band in Costa Rica, his maternal grandfather played the saxophone. As someone who enthusiastically tinkers in music production, Carv aspires to be half as cool as either of his abuelos.
