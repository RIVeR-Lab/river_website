## Biography

Tarik Kelestemur is a PhD Student in the [Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.neu.edu/) program at [Northeastern University](http://www.neu.edu/) under the supervision of [Robert Platt](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/rplatt/) and [Taşkın Padır](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/padir-taskin/).
He completed his MS degree in the same department in 2018. He received his
BS degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from [TOBB University of Economy and Technology](https://www.etu.edu.tr/en)
in Turkey. His research interests lie at the intersection of machine
learning and robotic manipulation. Specifically, he is interested in
methods combining classical robotic algorithms with data-driven methods
with applications to tactile manipulation. He also leads a team of
students, Team Northeastern, to participate in the [RoboCup@Home Challenge](http://www.robocupathome.org/).

Fun fact: Tarik is an amazing dancer.
