## Biography

Mark Zolotas received M.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Imperial College London, UK. He is currently a postdoctoral research associate in the Institute for Experiential Robotics at Northeastern University. His research interests span the domains of mixed reality, shared control and machine learning for human-robot interaction. All of these topics coincide with his overarching ambition to advance assistive robotics through transparent and seamless user experiences.

Fun fact: Mark went to the ER for a peanut stuck up his nose, aged 21.
