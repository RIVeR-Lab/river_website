## Biography

Michael Shaham is a PhD Candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Northeastern University. Michael’s current research portfolio includes secure and optimal control of convoys of unmanned ground vehicles. Previously, Michael led an interdisciplinary team of researchers to develop a system for Automation of Characterization and Evaluation of Personal Protective Equipment (ACE) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.


Fun fact: Michael took a gap year after undergrad to work in a ski-shop in Colorado. When he isn’t optimizing car convoys, you can find him doing backflips on double black diamonds.
