Gaurav Singh wrote his thesis: “Sporadic Audio, Visual Embodied Navigation For Human Tracking”. Humans locate and track objects and other humans in the environment using audio, vision and a basic sense of intuition based on direction of arrival of sound. Humans also use prior results of search in other rooms. Through this project, he implemented human search and rescue behavior on a robot with a goal of tracking and finding human in large areas or closed multi-room environments using sound, vision, lidar, sensor fusion and probabilistic approach.

Fun fact: Gaurav once tried milk & rice pudding with green hot pepper and the combo tasted like guava.
