Eric Dusel is a master's student studying robotics with a concentration in computer science and a Gordon Institute for Engineering Leadership candidate. His primary research focus is in shared autonomous reach augmentation which involves the development of a platform for a human operator to intuitively control an assistive robotic manipulator, or a.r.m, through sparse high-level commands. The system determines the goal from the input and autonomously plans and executes the task for the user.  

Fun fact: Eric created a website for fantasy football nerds to give and get advice.
