 abstract = {There is a need for semi-autonomous systems capable of performing both automated tasks and supervised maneuvers. When dealing with multiple robots or robots with high complexity (such as humanoids), we face the issue of effectively coordinating operators across robots. We build on our previous work to present a methodology for designing trajectories and policies for robots such that a few operators can supervise multiple robots. Specifically, we: (1) Analyze the complexity of the problem, (2) Design a procedure for generating policies allowing operators to oversee many robots, (3) Present a method for designing policies and robot trajectories to allow operators to oversee multiple robots, and (4) Include both simulation and hardware experiments demonstrating our methodologies.},
