abstract: 'There is a need for semi-autonomous systems capable of performing both
  automated tasks and supervised maneuvers. When dealing with multiple robots or robots
  with high complexity (such as humanoids), we face the issue of effectively coordinating
  operators across robots. We build on our previous work to present a methodology
  for designing trajectories and policies for robots such that a few operators can
  supervise multiple robots. Specifically, we: (1) Analyze the complexity of the problem,
  (2) Design a procedure for generating policies allowing operators to oversee many
  robots, (3) Present a method for designing policies and robot trajectories to allow
  operators to oversee multiple robots, and (4) Include both simulation and hardware
  experiments demonstrating our methodologies.'
