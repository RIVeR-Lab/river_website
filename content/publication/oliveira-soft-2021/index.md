abstract: The food industry is dependent on human labor for tasks that require tactile
  sensing, due in part to a lack of robotic sensors that are delicate enough to interact
  with food. In this paper we present the design, modeling, and performance of a durometer
  constructed with soft materials. We performed experiments to investigate the sensor's
  material selection, repeatability, drift, probing speed, and calibration. We also
  integrated the sensor into a commercial soft robotic gripper and used it to measure
  the hardness of an orange. The orange would be damaged by a traditional durometer,
  but the soft durometer left no visible marks. These results suggest that soft robotic
  sensors can benefit the food industry and overcome limitations associated with the
  interaction between robotic systems and fragile objects.
