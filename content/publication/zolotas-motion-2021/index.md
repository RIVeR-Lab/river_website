abstract: In remote applications that mandate human supervision, shared control can
  prove vital by establishing a harmonious balance between the high-level cognition
  of a user and the low-level autonomy of a robot. Though in practice, achieving this
  balance is a challenging endeavor that largely depends on whether the operator effectively
  interprets the underlying shared control. Inspired by recent works on using immersive
  technologies to expose the internal shared control, we develop a virtual reality
  system to visually guide human-in-the-loop manipulation. Our implementation of shared
  control teleoperation employs end effector manipulability polytopes, which are geometrical
  constructs that embed joint limit and environmental constraints. These constructs
  capture a holistic view of the constrained manipulatortextquoterights motion and
  can thus be visually represented as feedback for users on their operable space of
  movement. To assess the efficacy of our proposed approach, we consider a teleoperation
  task where users manipulate a screwdriver attached to a robotic armtextquoterights
  end effector. A pilot study with prospective operators is first conducted to discern
  which graphical cues and virtual reality setup are most preferable. Feedback from
  this study informs the final design of our virtual reality system, which is subsequently
  evaluated in the actual screwdriver teleoperation experiment. Our experimental findings
  support the utility of using polytopes for shared control teleoperation, but hint
  at the need for longer-term studies to garner their full benefits as virtual guides.
