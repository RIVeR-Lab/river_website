abstract: Package couriers are exposed to a strenuous work environment, where up~to
  one third of their time is spent loading and unloading vehicles manually. There
  is a clear need for robotic systems to augment the capacity of their vehicles while
  reducing costs and labor. The lightweight components and scalable workspaces of
  cable-driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs) make them a strong option for this application,
  however cable interference means deployment in cluttered environments is currently
  infeasible. In this paper, we propose a suspended CDPR consisting of a two stage
  end effector with a unique docking system. The design permits the end effector to
  latch itself into continuous docking struts fixed throughout the workspace, re-routing
  the cables and deploying a sub-CDPR which can operate freely between obstacles.
  The design of the mechanism and the robot are presented as well as its functional
  modes. Workspace analysis is conducted for both the docked and undocked configurations
  demonstrating the feasibility and utility of such a design.
