abstract: People with severe motor impairment oftentimes rely on unconventional assistive
  interfaces to complete daily activities. In this work, we developed a holistic shared
  control framework to help them achieve fast and accurate indoor navigation using
  low throughput human machine interfaces. Based off our previously developed shared
  position control method, we added orientation control, action control, and a state
  machine architecture to create the new framework Novelti 2.0 . The framework provides
  generic support for various LTIs. We validated the framework using Emotiv EPOC headset
  and a single-switch interface. A comprehensive comparative study involving 10 human
  subjects navigating a wheelchair in a real indoor environment demonstrated that
  our framework could achieve high navigation accuracy about 0.05 m for position and
  5° for orientation. Compared to steering control, our method required half the navigation
  time and half the number of commands in routes longer than 20 m. The NASA TLX survey
  results also indicated lower subjective workload with our method. Experimental data
  is provided for download and future evaluation.
