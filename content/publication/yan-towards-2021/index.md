abstract: 'Recent advances in visual sensing technology and unmanned aerial vehicle
  (UAV) provide an effective tool to capture the as-is conditions of infrastructure
  and thus have gained their popularity in infrastructure inspection and documentation.
  To facilitate this process, several recent studies have proposed automated methods
  for detecting concrete cracks from UAV-based images. This study is aimed at proposing
  a new method for automating both the detection and quantification of concrete cracks.
  The proposed method advances state-of-the-art image-based concrete crack detection
  methods by integrating the RGB images with the lidar data collected by UAV. The
  key innovations focus on two aspects: (1) by recognizing objects of interest in
  the lidar data, regions of interest can be extracted automatically from the images;
  (2) by retrieving the depth information through the lidar data, the actual pixel
  sizes can be estimated to facilitate both the detection and quantification of concrete
  cracks. In order to validate the proposed method, a customized UAV platform that
  was equipped with a high-resolution camera and a Velodyne VLP-16 lidar scanner was
  developed to scan the substructure elements of an in-service bridge where multiple
  concrete cracks can be observed. The effectiveness of the proposed method in recognizing
  and quantifying concrete cracks is validated quantitively against manually annotated
  images and physical measurements. The results indicate that the proposed approach
  can recognize crack pixels with an accuracy of 85% on average as well as quantify
  the recognized concrete cracks with an error less than 10%.'
